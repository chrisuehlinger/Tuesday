Esprima vs. Acorn
I ran some online benchmarks, the results were inconclusive.
As of 2012, Acorn was half the size of Esprima.
Acorn looked like a hacked together hobby project, while Esprima struck me as more professional.
Esprima wins out for documentation. Esprima’s docs include Demos, examples and tutorials. Acorn’s docs consist of an annotated copy of the source, which is more difficult to search and contains unnecessary information.

API
var tuesday = new Tuesday();
tuesday.whitelist([“for”, “if”]);
tuesday.blacklist([“while”, “switch”]);
tuesday.structure({“for”: {“if”: { }}});
tuesday.code(codeFromCodeMirror);
tuesday.start();
